For more than twenty years, founder Dave Kedzior worked with technology in homes, businesses, and community spaces across Chicagoland. He saw people asking for modern solutions but ending up frustrated by confusing systems, poor quality products, and companies focused on selling rather than support. TechNest was created to offer a better experience.</p> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Our mission is to bring comfort, security, and ease to homes and small businesses through thoughtful design, clear guidance, and reliable installation. We believe in listening first, explaining things clearly, and creating solutions that fit how people actually live and work. That might mean stronger Wi Fi, safer entry points, better sound for entertaining, or smoother daily operations.</p> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Today, the TechNest team shares a customer first approach rooted in the local community. We focus on clean installations, fair pricing, and dependable support long after the work is done. Every space is different, and we take pride in tailoring technology that feels simple, reliable, and empowering for our neighbors across the Chicagoland area.</p> </div> </section> <section class="our-values" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r> <div class="values-container" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r> <h2 data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Our Values</h2> <div class="value-item" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r> <h3 data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Authenticity and reliability</h3> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>We show up as real people who do what we say we will.
